### A Chrome-Extension for creating and deploying Scratch Themes.

The vision is to make an easy to use chrome extension for themes on the scratch-website. It should also be possible to create your own color pallets and share your themes as a string that can be imported into the extensions by other users.

### If u are a developer and want to help out:
Firstly we need to find and put all visible classes on the scratch editor page that we want to change the background-class of, in the "changeData" list. This process is pretty straight forward but a bit time-consuming. Syntax for the "changeData" list:
>[className, colorCode, styleType]

Second, we need to make the visual UI for the extension. This part I would need some help from someone more experienced with making chrome extensions.
